# Behavioral-Econ-Simulator

## üåç Overview

The Behavioral Economics Simulator models the decisions of agents (consumers/investors) influenced by psychological biases in a dynamic, simplified market environment. It challenges traditional rational-choice theory by integrating behavioral economic principles into the logic of decision-making.

The simulator is a learning tool designed to show how irrational choices can cause unexpected and realistic effects like bubbles, panics, and stagnation.

## üß† Why Behavioral Economics?

Traditional economics assumes humans are **rational** and make perfect decisions that maximize utility with perfect logic and information. However, in reality, human decisions are bounded by emotion, cognitive shortcuts (heuristics), and social influence.

Behavioral economics studies those deviations. This simulator demonstrates key ideas:

- Bounded Rationality = limited cognitive processing leads to imperfect choices.
- Heuristics & Biases = people rely on mental shortcuts like anchoring or loss aversion.
- Loss Aversion = people prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains. Investors sell winning stocks early and hold onto losers too long.
- Herd Behavior = Individuals mimic the actions of a larger group. Stock market bubbles and crashes often result from this.
- Overconfidence Bias = People overestimate their knowledge or ability to predict. Leads to excessive trading and poor risk assessment.
- Status Quo Bias = Tendency to prefer things to stay the same. People avoid changing portfolios or trying new financial products.
